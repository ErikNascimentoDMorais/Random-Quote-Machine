# Random-Quote-Machine
The Random Quote Machine is a web application designed to display random quotes from a predefined collection. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app dynamically updates the displayed quote and its author with each user interaction.

Current Features:
  A simple and clean HTML structure for easy readability and functionality.
  A JavaScript script that:
  Randomly selects a quote from an array of quotes.
  Updates the quote and author in real-time when the user clicks a button.
  A basic CSS stylesheet for styling the layout and design.
  A focus on modularity and scalability to incorporate future enhancements.
Planned Features:
  Integration of frontend libraries/frameworks like React, Bootstrap, or Tailwind CSS to improve styling, responsiveness, and maintainability.
  A more visually appealing user interface.
  Options to share quotes on social media or copy them to the clipboard.
  Potentially fetching quotes from an external API to provide a more dynamic experience.
